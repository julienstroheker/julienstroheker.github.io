When people ask me : "Hey Julien, how I can learn DevOps ?", my anwser is around experience and practices.

So usally people are asking : "Do you have good resources for examples or exercices around DevOps Practices" instead of doing research eveytime for the same resources 
I decided to start this blog post with all the resources related to DevOps Practices : Blogs, GitHub Repo, Videos, Books ...

With the time, I realised that I am always referering to the same links, this how I decided to start this Cheat Sheet ! 

An easy way to everything in one and same place :)

> I originally posted this article in my previous blog on technet, but I will only update this one for now.

Your boss has asked you to do DevOps ? No surprise as the term DevOps has become a trendy word. DevOps however is more than just Devs and Ops working together. It is not something you can buy with your credit card. The efficiencies the process provides on behalf of a supported organization can yield increased productivity between IT Professionals, Developers and Business Decision Makers.

Yes… But where I'm supposed to start ??? What will be my learning path ?

That's why I'm offering to you all my links from where I learned, learn and still learning every day.

Value stream mapping--an essential but underused methodology--is a proven approach to help you visualize and resolve disconnects, redundancies, and gaps in your value delivery system.
