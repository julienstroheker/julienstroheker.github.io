<p>Hi ! I am Julien Stroheker and I am working at Microsoft as Technical Evangelist on DevOps</p>

<p>I like talking and sharing about how Dev and Ops can be better together and work as a strong team.</p>

<p>From a strong <b>Ops</b>, profile I am trying to becoming a <b>developper</b> to have a better understanding about this <b>DevOps</b> thing.</p>

<p>On this challenging journey, I am learning all this new cool stuffs like Javascript & NodeJs and Python or the other side MongoDB for example...</p>

<p>I try to share here my personal and professional thought. All posts here are my personal opinion, and not related to Microsoft.</p>

<p>Oh BTW, "Je suis Fran√ßais" and I am trying to improve my english everyday, so you could see a lot of grammatical errors, don't hesitate to reach me and rectify my mistake :) </p>
