<p>Hi ! I am Julien Stroheker and I am working at Microsoft as a Technical Evangelist on DevOps</p>

<p>I like talking and sharing about how Dev and Ops can be better together and work as a strong team.</p>

<p>From a <b>Ops</b> background profile, I am trying to become a better <b>developper</b> to have an through understanding about this <b>DevOps</b> thing.</p>

<p>On this challenging journey, I am learning all these new cool things like, Javascript / NodeJs and Python as well as MongoDB for example...</p>

<p>I aim to share my personal and professional thoughts in this blog. All posts here are my personal opinion, and do not reprensent Microsoft.</p>

<p>And BTW, "Je suis Fran√ßais" and I am trying to improve my English everyday, so you might see a lot of grammatical errors, if so, do not hesitate to reach me and help me rectify my mistake(s) :)</p>
